# ashlandks

A tiny static repository containing a single web page: `index.html`.

## What this repo is

- A minimal static site/workspace. The root of the project contains an `index.html` file.

## Files

- `index.html` — the main web page. Open it in a browser to view the site.

## How to run / view

You can view the site locally in two easy ways:

1. Open the file directly in your browser (double-click `index.html` or use `File → Open`).

2. Serve it with a simple static server (recommended when testing relative paths):

```bash
# from the repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Development notes

- Edit `index.html` to change content. No build step or dependencies are required.

## License

No license specified. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to make the project's license explicit.
